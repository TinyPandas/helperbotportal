					<h4> <a href="https://discord.gg/x4J7zhx">New discord server</a> </h4>
					<p> As many of you may already be aware, I have created a test build of HelperBot, with a dedicated server for it. </p>
					<p> This also means, more frequent smaller changes, before they go live. I welcome all members to come and test. </p>
					<p> The test build uses <mark>!</mark> as the command symbol, vs the live build using <mark>$</mark></p>
					<p> If you find an error, please use <mark><symbol>erq [command]</mark> </p>
					<p> </p>
					<p> Thank you for your continued support! </p>
